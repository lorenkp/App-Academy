**Associations!**

Welcome to the associations exercise.

Check out the `db/schema.rb` to see what your database will look like.

Check out `db/seeds.rb` to see what test data your database will contain.

Run `rake db:reset` to create the tables exactly as they exist in the `schema`.

This command will also seed your database with test data.

To get started associating your models, open up your model classes, conveniently
stored in `app/models/` and start writing `has_many` and `belongs_to`.

Be sure and test your associations in the `rails console` to ensure that they
work.
